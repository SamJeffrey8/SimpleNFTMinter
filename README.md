# Plutus Platform starter project

This project gives a simple starter project for using the Plutus Platform.

## Setting up

### VSCode devcontainer

Use the provided VSCode devcontainer to get an environment with the correct tools set up.

- Install Docker
- Install VSCode
  - Install the [Remote Development extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)
  - You do *not* need to install the Haskell extension
- Ensure you have a `~/.cabal/packages` folder. You can create this via `mkdir -p ~/.cabal/packages`; it's used to cache cabal packages.
- Clone this repository and open it in VSCode
  - It will ask if you want to open it in the container, say yes.
  - The first time it will take a few minutes to download the devcontainer image from dockerhub,
  - `cabal build` from the terminal should work (unless you didn't have a `~/.cabal` folder, in which case you'll need to run `cabal update` first.)
  - Opening a Haskell file should give you IDE features (it takes a little while to set up the first time)

Note: This uses the [plutus-starter-devcontainer image on dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/inputoutput/plutus-starter-devcontainer), if
you wish to build the image yourself, you can do so as follows:
  - Clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus,
  - Set up your machine to build things with Nix, following the [Plutus README](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/master/README.adoc) (make sure to set up the binary cache!),
  - Build and load the docker container: `docker load < $(nix-build default.nix -A devcontainer)`,
  - Adjust the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file to point to your local image.

### Cabal+Nix build

Alternatively, use the Cabal+Nix build if you want to develop with incremental builds, but also have it automatically download all dependencies.

Set up your machine to build things with `Nix`, following the [Plutus README](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/master/README.adoc) (make sure to set up the binary cache!).

To enter a development environment, simply open a terminal on the project's root and use `nix-shell` to get a bash shell:

```
$ nix-shell
```

Otherwise, you can use [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) which allows you to use your preferred shell. Once installed, just run:

```
$ echo "use nix" > .envrc # Or manually add "use nix" in .envrc if you already have one
$ direnv allow
```

and you'll have a working development environment for now and the future whenever you enter this directory.

The build should not take too long if you correctly set up the binary cache. If it starts building GHC, stop and setup the binary cache.

Afterwards, the command `cabal build` from the terminal should work (if `cabal` couldn't resolve the dependencies, run `cabal update` and then `cabal build`).

Also included in the environment is a working [Haskell Language Server](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server) you can integrate with your editor.
See [here](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server#configuring-your-editor) for instructions.

## The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) example

We have provided an example PAB application in `./pab`. With the PAB we can serve and interact
with contracts over a web API. You can read more about the PAB here: [PAB Architecture](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/master/plutus-pab/ARCHITECTURE.adoc).

Here, the PAB is configured with one contract, the `SimpleNFT` contract from `./examples/src/Plutus/Contracts/SimpleNFT.hs`.

Here's an example of running and interacting with this contract via the API. For this it will help if you
have `jq` installed.

1. Build the PAB executable:

```
cabal build simplenft
```

2. Run the PAB binary:

```
cabal exec -- simplenft
````

This will then start up the server on port 9080. The devcontainer process will then automatically expose this port so that you can connect to it from any terminal (it doesn't have to be a terminal running in the devcontainer).

First, let's verify that the game is present in the server:

3. Check what contracts are present:

```
curl -s http://localhost:9080/api/contract/definitions | jq
```

You should receive a list of contracts and the endpoints that can be called on them, and the arguments
required for those endpoints.

We're interested in the `NFTContract` one.
